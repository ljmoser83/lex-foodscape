# Lexington, KY Foodscape Mapping Project

## I. Introduction
The goal of the *Lexington, KY Foodscape Mapping Project* is to design an interactive web map that explores the foodscape concept and investigates the prevalence and location of various types of food options in Lexington, Kentucky. This project will visualize how demographic characteristics, health indicators of residents, measures of economic prosperity, and accessibility serve as explanatory and response variables for shaping a foodscape. Map users will gain a better understanding of the Lexington, KY foodscape. Gaining this understanding will raise awareness of food system equity. 

## II. Methodology

### D. Thematic representation
-I am considering utilizing visualizations with kde plots that aggregate based on the definition of various foodscape phenomena (food swamp, desert, areas of healthy foods).

-For Web design, I am looking into using the mapbox framework for user interface design. I am also going to look into adding a mapbox (or smililar) geocoder to the website so that people can investigate specific locations, by address, in Lexington.

### E. User interaction
